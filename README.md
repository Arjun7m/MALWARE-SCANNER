# MALWARE-SCANNER
This Malware scanner uses hash matching technique to identify threats to the system. The program is primarily written in C++ with Qt Libraries. It maintains a local database of MD5 hashes for 'local scan' functionality and executes an API call to Virus Total API for 'Internet Scan' functionality. 

This project was made towards the fulfillment of the minor project requirement of the course IT-321 Malware Analysis.
